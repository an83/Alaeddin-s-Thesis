\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Why AR continuum: First of all, I think you need to better motivate the AR continuum. So why do you do this? In give you here a pathway but this needs to be expanded (and of course can be changed): }{23}{section*.72}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Mixed and Augmented Reality allows us to visualise information in place. These information can have a specific relation with that place (e.g. textual labels providing addition information wrt. the place) but their relation can also be that the place is just a good \IeC {\textquotedblleft }position\IeC {\textquotedblright } to visualise this information (e.g. a physical wall in a room being a good position to visualise/augment pictorial information that have otherwise no immediate connection to this wall). In particular the latter can also be used to visualise information created within the social networks of the user. This is of relevance because social networks (private and professional) are nowadays probably one of the biggest data source/content generator for digital information. Given the sheer amount of information a intuitive and effective visualisation of these information may support the user when AR interfaces are more ubiquitous. However, when visualising these information special care has to be take not only on where to place them but also on how to visualise this information. Besides on the question on where to place the digital information a key question is also on how this information can be represented depending on the social proximity between the users / their social graph. This is the motivation for defining a Social AR continuum that identifies the main dimensions that can be manipulated when exploring sharing of experiences and information using an AR interface\IeC {\textellipsis }. blabla bla\IeC {\textellipsis }. }{23}{section*.73}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Again this is just some sentences that just came out of my head. You can use or not use at your own risk and will. However, it has to be expanded (your story but also my draft above) as there is way more to say about. At occasions you will have the feeling that you will repeat things that you mentioned earlier (e.g. introduction and related work). That is normal and the repeating of information is often needed for the reader to follow your motivation and argumentation Remember: Your reviewers are likely reading you thesis late after work and will be tired. An occasional reminder what this is all about will be appreciated as long as it is coherent and you do not start to contradict yourself. }{23}{section*.74}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ How have you methodologically created the AR continuum: Once you made clear why you need this continuum, you need to also better explain how you have created it. It sounds at the moment a bit like, we need it, and here it is. But how have you created it? Brainstorming alone, with colleagues, any well know HCI approach? A brainstorming meeting with AR professionals could be the answer here but what has driven this brainstorming and what was the overarching idea. Why are certain metrics not in the continuum and could have looked differently? Do you have earlier versions that you can share and explain why they needed more work. I think if you can demonstrate the iterative development that the model underwent, it would support you. In any case you need to explain how you have designed it. }{24}{section*.77}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Scenarios: First of all I like the graphics etc. I was even thinking if you should start with the scenarios before coming to the AR continuum. Basically, if you could use your scenarios to better motivate the need for an AR continuu?! Later you can use them again to explain some of the dimensions. In any case they are under-utilised at the moment. They need a better explanation and a better integration. For example: I would not start with the decoration one because it is the weakest one in my opinion. Maybe better start with the working from home and the social meeting. You could start with that there is increasingly support for working from home (reference needed) and AR/MR could be a key technology here to connect remote teams and people (references needed here). However, when sharing information (could be this or this or this) with remote parties we should consider also their social proximity when deciding on what to share and how to share it. Lets consider the following example where user A is working from home. He is using an AR system to share \IeC {\textellipsis }.. blabla bla\IeC {\textellipsis } explain all the things no just what is depicted in the picture\IeC {\textellipsis }. later explain the other scenarios but similarly motivate for each scenario why this is a valid and important scenario. }{28}{section*.87}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Again these are all recommendations and you can take it or leave it (or take parts of it). In any case you need to integrate more references. I only put in the last part some examples on where they are needed but basically every big statement should be supported. I think this is all important because when the reader is not buying in into your scenarios, you will have a hard time selling your conceptual solutions for each scenario. The reader will simply say: The scenario is not a real scenario or is to unrelevant to be addressed by a PhD thesis as it is not solving a real problem (current and future). This is a bit the issue with the decoration scenario which is a bit random. Keep it but do not put it first. }{28}{section*.88}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Finally, please be more verbose in your figure captions. I have the tendency to be very long (see my PhD thesis and most of my papers) but really take the space to explain what is going on in the figure and do not only provide a \IeC {\textquotedblleft }figure name\IeC {\textquotedblright }. It is ok if parts are replicated in the body text. But the figure should work without the body text and the body text should work without the figure caption. }{28}{section*.89}
