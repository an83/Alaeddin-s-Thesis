\chapter{Social Interactions in AR}
\label{ch:annotation}

After studying the dimensions of representation of social contacts (Chapter~\ref{ch:contacts}) and shared social data (Chapter~\ref{ch:data}), this chapter examines the dimension interactions between social contacts with each other and with other virtual objects. The interaction is represented by adding an AR tag or annotation on a shared medium to socially connect with other users.

Annotation is an example of interactions between social contacts and social data. This interaction can be represented in different levels of detail based on social proximity. Four types of annotation can be defined by the attachment status (attached/de-attached) and the co-location (on/off location) with the user \cite{Hansen2006}. This chapter explores these options of the taxonomy and how they would fit on the Social AR Continuum dimensions of interactions.

This chapter aims to answer the research question \ref{rq:data}: "How can wearable AR displays be used best for interacting with social contacts and shared social data?"
Annotation is one of the social interaction methods where users can add text or other information to be overlaid on top of a shared medium for the purpose of communicating ideas or thoughts between participants. This chapter explores different media and options for sharing annotations with social contacts. AR annotations are useful for remote collaboration and shared experiences where context or descriptions of the conversation can be highlighted.

The sections of this chapter focus on the annotation dimension and explore how annotation can be used in different scenarios of sharing social experiences. The first section \ref{sec:video} addresses annotation of a live video stream. The second section \ref{sec:3D} studies annotation of a 3D environment using 3D sensors to detect the shared surrounding environment. The last section \ref{sec:pano} looks into panorama images as a medium and explores awareness and collaboration techniques. The other dimensions on the interaction continuum are out of the scope of this thesis and will be addressed in future work.
