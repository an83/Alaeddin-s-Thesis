\section{Summary}

This chapter explored different options of representing social interactions in AR including samples of 1) sharing annotations on panoramic video, 2) sharing 3D annotation using depth cameras, and 3) sharing 360 panoramic image with annotation and awareness cues. These explorations include user studies measure social presence, usability and user' feedback/preference. These interactions can be used on the social AR continuum to control the interactions between social contacts and shared data based on social proximity. For instance, for closer relationship, higher fidelity of social interactions (e.g., 3D annotations and drawing) can be enabled, while lower fidelity (e.g., text list annotations and pointing) is for future away social relationship.

The following chapter will summarise the conclusions of the entire thesis and highlight few future directions from this research.
