The primary goal of the work reported in this thesis is to explore, develop and evaluate novel interaction techniques for Augmented Reality (AR) wearable headsets, focusing on how they can be used to share social experiences with family and friends. AR has the potential to provide an intuitive and natural approach to sharing our social experiences in life with others while being co-present. In order to better visualise and interact with social networks on wearable AR devices, we introduce the concept of the ``Social AR Continuum'', which describes the space of sharing experiences on AR in various dimensions. This work discusses the advantages and limitations of various implementations and techniques of shared social experiences on wearable AR.  

Based on Human-Computer Interaction methodologies, we conducted user studies to evaluate user presences and system usability of our implementation for visualising, sharing and interacting with social experiences on AR headsets. The work focused on the essential Social AR Continuum dimensions of representing contacts, sharing data and interactions, developed user interfaces on these dimensions and evaluated them using user studies. Our results show that using AR to share social experiences can increase users' social presence. The results are summarised as design recommendations to help interface designers better design shared social experiences on wearable AR systems. 

% Content: Can you insert in this where each of the user studies will be discussed? Also, don't you think the Social AR Continuum deserves its own chapter? Seems like one of the main topics of the thesis, and something you can attach your name to, so it should be highlighted. Also, there you can outline many possible axes, then go deep on the three you have chosen to explore. This indicates fertile areas that others can explore within the Continuum.
