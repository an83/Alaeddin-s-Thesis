\chapter{Social Contacts in AR}
\label{ch:contacts} 

This chapter focuses on how to represent social contacts through a wearable AR device. The aim is to answer the research question \ref{rq:people}: \textit{What dimensions work best for visualising and interacting with social contacts through wearable AR displays?}. To answer this question, this chapter explores two dimensions of the social AR continuum: 1) representing social contacts and 2) placement of social contacts. The representation of social contact varies based on their relationship with the user. 
In the first section \ref{sec:contacts:visualising}, we look into options of visualising social contacts as avatars with multiple levels of details. The second section \ref{sec:contacts:placing} looks into options for placement of social contacts. 

% Gun Lee: Give recap of the "People" dimensions you defined in Chapter 3 to give context on why and how the following sections link back to these concepts.
