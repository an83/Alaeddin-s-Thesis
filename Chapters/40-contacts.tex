\chapter{Visualising Social Contacts}
\label{ch:contacts} 

This chapter focus on how to represent social contacts through a wearable AR device. 
This chapter aims to answer the research question \textit{RQ4: How to visualise our social contacts as virtual avatars on wearable AR devices}.
The representation of social contact varies based on their relationship with the user. 
In the first section \ref{sec:contacts:visualising}, we look into options of visualising social contacts as avatars with multiple levels of details. The second section \ref{sec:contacts:placing} looks into options for placement of social contacts.
