\chapter{Social Contacts in AR}
\label{ch:contacts} 

The previous chapter presented the concept of the Social AR Continuum, together with examples for its relevance. This work identifies the representation of social contacts as one of the main dimensions within our social AR continuum. Here, this section distinguishes in particular how to present social contacts (e.g., visual fidelity) and where to present them (spatial mapping such as proximity). This chapter then expands by focusing on this dimension and exploring different visualisation types along this dimension. 

This chapter focuses on how to represent social contacts through a wearable AR device. The aim is to answer the research question \ref{rq:people}: \textit{What dimensions work best for visualising and interacting with social contacts through wearable AR displays?}. This chapter aims to answer this question by exploring two dimensions of the Social AR Continuum: 1) representing social contacts and 2) placement of social contacts (Figure \ref{fig:contacts:contacts-continuum}). The representation of social contact varies based on their relationship with the user. 
The first section (\ref{sec:contacts:visualising}) looks into options of visualising social contacts as avatars with multiple levels of detail. The second section (\ref{sec:contacts:placing}) looks into options for placement of social contacts.

% Gun Lee: Give a recap of the "People" dimensions you defined in Chapter 3 to give context on why and how the following sections link back to these concepts.
