\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

Augmented Reality (AR) is technology that enables the seamless merging of the real world with virtual content (including visual and audio) so that both real and virtual can be seen and interacted with at the same time. Azuma defined AR as the coexistence of the virtual world and the real world, and that "it would appear to the user that the virtual and real objects coexisted in the same space"  \cite{azuma1997survey}. Milgram defined the mixed reality (MR) continuum (Figure \ref{fig:mr-continuum}) and placed AR between virtual reality (VR) where full immersion of virtual contents and augmented virtuality (AV) where mostly virtual content is overlaid by real content \cite{Milgram1995a}.

We as humans are social creatures and it is our way to stay connected with each other, communicating our identity and the feeling of relatedness to one another \cite{HuangWeidong2013}. Social interactions help establishing mutual understandings in collaborative scenarios, and therefore can be used as an effectiveness measure of collaborative technology \cite{Li2013}. Social interactions has been influenced by technology. For instance the use of emoticons has been used in written communication instead of text to represent our emotions, intentions and cultural differences \cite{Pavalanathan2016}, and was found to be related to expressing emotions in face-to-face situations \cite{Derks2007}. 

One of the advantages of AR in communicating social dynamics is that it enables the user to interact with virtual contents while keeping social connections with people around in the real world \cite{HuangWeidong2013}. Mobile AR facilitate shared spaces and experiences with remote users which add to social connections and increase users' engagement. Having people contributing to an AR content would lead to increase in sense of community and inter-connectedness. However, when more information is shared, there is more risk of reducing the sense of privacy \cite{Olsson2013}. In a study of social interaction and mobility in AR games, and found that with mobile AR games, players are more likely to interact with each other socially and physically, which lead to increase the enjoyment of AR experience \cite{Schmalstieg_144}. 

AR could improve social interactions by making people more connected with each other and excited about sharing virtual experiences with each other, and making the social experience richer with additional virtual content. 

In \cite{Zhou2008} and \cite{Kim2018} looked at trends in AR in the academic conference ISMAR\footnote{http://www.ismar.net/} and in the research community as a whole, and reported "\textit{AR technology will continue to develop even more dynamically and effectively over the next ten years, toward the vision of pervasive presence in our daily lives.}" \cite{Kim2018}. AR displays are getting more affordable with better rendering and registration techniques. Also, AR displays are becoming more self-contained and lighter which enables mobile AR applications.

In a review about the historic uses of wearable displays and AR displays \cite{Peddie2017}, it started in 1940 with the first heads-up display (HUD) in the UK. Then in the 1960s, most uses of AR were to build AR helmet for pilots field of view. Then interest in AR started increasing in 2009 when Lego introduced AR Digital box, then started relative decline since Google Glass was introduced in 2012. In the Gartner 2019 trends report \cite{gartner2019}, it shows that AR and immersive technologies have been getting out the disillusionment phase of the hype cycle and moving toward a steady adoption and day to day scenarios in the next 5-10 years.

\section{Problem Statement}

With the rapid development of technology and the potential use of AR in every day life, this thesis aims to study the challenges in social AR in the near future. The focus of this thesis is on enabling the use of wearable AR for sharing social experiences. The gap between the vision of social AR and the current state of the art is that the state of the art in AR research was focused on a task-oriented collaborative AR more than social AR. Initial attempts of exploring social AR in 2013 (at the beginning of this thesis) were limited to single or few number of user(s) experience. This thesis explores how would multiple people use social AR to connect with each other, the shared virtual space and the interactions techniques. 

This PhD thesis addresses the problems of: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item using visualising and interacting with social contacts through wearable AR displays.
    \item displaying a large amount of 3D content of sharing social data that is overlaid over a limited available physical space through wearable AR devices.
    \item defining and exploring the best ways to use wearable AR devices to connect with social networks.
\end{enumerate}

Previously, handheld AR systems have been used to view social networks in a number of different ways. For example, Presslite's Twitter 360\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w7EAz8-uwU} (Figure \ref{fig:presslite}) shows virtual tweets overlaid on the real world at the locations of the people that sent them , and early versions of Junaio\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junaio} allowed people to drop virtual messages and pictures in the real world, as did the popular application Sekai Camera\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxnKOQkWwF8}. Most of these applications were focused on asynchronous collaboration, enabling people to post virtual messages in space which can later be browsed and retrieved by other users.

\end{figure}

However, similar technology could also be used for live synchronous collaboration such as live video avatar sharing~\cite{Billinghurst2002}, sharing realistic 3D models superimposed over the real world~\cite{Fanello2016}, or by using virtual avatars to show a live view of remote collaborators and their surrounding space as in the Holoportation system~\cite{Fanello2016} (Figure \ref{fig:holoportation}).

% - Sharing social experiences was not fully addressed in the research community

With major industry players (e.g., Microsoft, Facebook and Magic Leap) supporting AR, a potential use of AR could be for connecting with social networks. Just as people today use their mobile phones to connect with hundreds or thousands of friends, wearable AR displays could be used to connect with friends and view and interact with their shared information.

Applications for Social VR and 360-degree video have been introduced on new VR headsets. For instance, Facebook Spaces\footnote{https://www.facebook.com/spaces} allows VR users to connect with friends and family and share 360-degree photos and take selfies. AltSpaceVR\footnote{https://altvr.com/} was acquired by Microsoft and enables more diverse hand-held and wearable devices to be used for social connection with others. Most recently, Magic Leap's Avatar Chat\footnote{https://www.magicleap.com/stories/blog/connect-with-friends-with-avatar-chat}(Figure \ref{fig:ml-avatar-chat}) offers similar experiences where avatars representing social friends are displayed in an AR space .

\end{figure}

By using a wearable AR display like the Microsoft HoloLens\footnote{https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/hololens}, it could be possible for the user to see an AR representation of their social network visible at all times. However, this raises the question of how to visually represent the user's contacts in the network. For example, if a user has a large social network with hundreds of contacts available, visually representing each of them might clutter the user's visual space.

The limitation of prior work is that until recently (2018) there was no comprehensive analysis of the social AR space and no sufficient exploration of sharing social experiences on wearable AR. 

It is easy to imagine that in the future it will be possible for wearable AR systems to be used to capture and share a 3D view of the user's surroundings with hundreds or thousands of followers on a social network. However, before this becomes commonplace, many important research questions need to be addressed. For example, would a person be comfortable sharing a view of their surrounding real space with relative strangers? This work aims to explore how wearable AR systems could share a userâ€™s surrounding room environment with social contacts and to measure how comfortable the sharer and the viewer would feel regarding privacy within different interface options. 

If AR is to be used to represent contacts in social networks, there could be a large number of contacts to show. Our research has benefited from earlier work on different ways of managing large amounts of information in AR interfaces.

In the following section, this thesis outlines the research questions based on the above problem space and the gap identified in previous work.

\section{Research Questions}

This thesis targets the future where AR devices are used every day, and social networks are visualised in the AR view. The overarching research question is \textit{how AR can be be used for sharing social experiences in both remote and face to face social contacts}. We address the following research questions: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=RQ\arabic*]
    % (chapter 3 - Social AR continuum)
    \item{\label{rq:continuum}What dimensions/factors/parameters in sharing social experiences on wearable AR devices?
    % \\(option 1): How to represent social networks and shared social data on wearable AR devices?

    }
    % (chapter 6 - visualising social contacts) 
    \item{\label{rq:people}What dimensions work best for visualising and interacting with social contacts through wearable AR displays?
    % \\(option 1): How to visualise our social contacts as virtual avatars on wearable AR devices?

    % \\(option 4): What is the impact of visualising social contacts on social presence?
    % \\(option 5): What is the impact on social presence of different visualisation methods for social contacts?
    }
\end{enumerate}

To answer the research questions, this thesis explores how wearable AR can be used for sharing social experiences. These explorations identify the parameters through which AR sharing for social reasons happen. Once the parameters are defined, we build a system prototypes as a proofs of concept of the experiences or interaction designs. We then run user studies to test the objectives of each system with human participants. We observe their behaviour and report on the results of these experiments. 

Chapter \ref{ch:continuum}: "The Social AR Continuum" aims to answer \ref{rq:continuum} with describing the overall dimensions on the social AR continuum. Chapter \ref{ch:annotation} "Annotation Continuum" aims to answer \ref{rq:interaction} with exploring annotations and tags for sharing social experience. Chapter \ref{ch:data} "Sharing Data Continuum" focuses more about the data being shared with social contacts and aiming to answer \ref{rq:data}. Chapter \ref{ch:contacts} "Visualising Social Contacts" aims to answer \ref{rq:people} by exploring visualising social contacts. 

\section{Contributions}

The following summarises the contributions of this thesis: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We identify the parameters and dimensions of the social AR continuum. The main contribution is defining the social AR continuum which consists of a set of parameters that define the space of sharing social experiences through wearable/hand-held AR devices. We define the space of the AR continuum by exploring the main parameters that can be varied based on social proximity. These parameters are grouped into the following categories 1) self and other, 2) shared objects \& surrounding environment and 3) interactions and annotations. Under each of these categories, we define the dimensions of variables that affect the shared social experience.
    
    \item We implemented several social AR experiences in terms of user interfaces. For each dimension defined on the continuum, we built software prototypes to test the user interface design with human subjects. The implementation details are described in the thesis for future use.
    
    \item We conducted user studies to evaluate and validate the parameters of the social AR continuum. Using the prototypes we constructed, a series of user-studies and focus-groups were conducted to validate the dimensions of the social AR continuum.
    
    \item We synthesised high-level design guidelines for interface designers looking to build social sharing experiences on AR devices. One of the outcomes of defining the social AR continuum and validating these dimensions is that our work can serve as high-level experience design guidelines that help individuals and organisations to create effective AR experiences for social sharing and connection purposes.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, this thesis helps to increase the understanding of how to share social experiences through AR devices. The results of the user experiments conducted throughout this research help identify the impact of the social AR continuum parameters on presence, user engagement and user interface usability, which serves as guidelines for future designs. 

The rest of the thesis is organised as follows: Chapter \ref{ch:continuum} describes the social AR continuum and the parameters/dimensions involved. Chapter \ref{ch:annotation} describes the shared data and annotation continuum including different implementations of shared annotation and awareness cues on different platforms (hand-held and wearable). Chapter \ref{ch:data} describes the surrounding environment continuum including shared 360-degree videos and 30 captured spaces. Chapter \ref{ch:contacts} describes the continuum of self and others of representing social contact networks on AR devices. The following diagram (Figure \ref{fig:thesis-outline}) shows the structure of the thesis and how it answers the research questions.
