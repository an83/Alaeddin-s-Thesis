% In this chapter, we introduce mixed-reality continuum. AR/VR becoming popular. Previous research focus on single users or collaboration with few users. The question remain how AR will be used with many uses and in social situations. The Social AR Continuum can be an answer to this question.

Augmented Reality (AR) is technology that enables the seamless overlay of virtual images on the real world, so that both real and virtual can be seen and interacted with at the same time. 

\cite{azuma1997survey} defined AR as the coexistence of the virtual world and the real world "it would appear to the user that the virtual and real objects coexisted in the same space" (Figure \ref{fig:video-see-through}).

Milgram \cite{Milgram1995a} defined the mixed reality (MR) continuum and placed augmented reality (mostly real content overlaid by virtual content) between virtual reality (VR) where full immersion of virtual contents and augmented virtuality (AV) where mostly virtual content overlaid by real content (Figure \ref{fig:mr-continuum}).

\cite{Zhou2008, Kim2018} looked at trend of augmented reality in the academic conference ISMAR and looked at trends in research community and reported "dramatic increase of commercial interest in AR/MR" and "AR technology will continue to develop even more dynamically and effectively over the next ten years, toward the vision of pervasive presence in our daily lives.". AR display are getting more affordable with better rendering and registration techniques. Also AR displays are getting unteathered enabling mobile AR applications and self-contained displays are entering the market.

\section{Problem Statement}

This PhD thesis addresses the problems of: 
(1) using visualising and interacting with social contacts through wearable augmented reality displays. 
(2) displaying huge amount of 3D content of sharing social data that is overlaid over a limited available physical space through wearable AR devices. 
(3) defining and exploring the best ways to use wearable AR devices to connect with social networks.
The focus of this thesis is on enabling the use of wearable AR for sharing social experiences. 

% - The potential for AR to be a social sharing platform. \\
% - Sharing social experiences was not fully addressed in the research community

With major industry players (e.g. Microsoft, Facebook and Apple) supporting Augmented Reality (AR), more potential use of AR/VR could be for connecting with social networks. Just as people today use their mobile phones to connect with hundreds or thousands of "friends", wearable AR displays could be used to connect with friends and view and interact with their shared information.

Applications for Social VR and 360 video have been introduced on new VR headsets. For instance Facebook Spaces\footnote{https://www.facebook.com/spaces} allows VR users to connect with friends and family and share 360 photos and take selfies. AltSpaceVR\footnote{https://altvr.com/} was acquired by Microsoft and enable more diverse hand-held and wearable devices to be used for social connection with others. Most recently Magic Leap's Avatar Chat\footnote{https://www.magicleap.com/stories/blog/connect-with-friends-with-avatar-chat} offers similar experences where avatars representing social friends are displayed in an AR space. 

Previously, handheld AR systems have been used to view social networks in a number of different ways. For example, Presslite's Twitter 360\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w7EAz8-uwU} shows virtual tweets overlaid on the real world at the locations of the people that sent them (see figure \ref{fig:presslite}), and early versions of Junaio\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junaio} allowed people to drop virtual messages and pictures in the real world, as did the popular application Sekai Camera\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxnKOQkWwF8}. Most of these applications were focused on asynchronous collaboration, enabling people to post virtual messages in space which can later be browsed and retrieved by other users.

\end{figure}

However similar technology could also be used for live synchronous collaboration such as live video avatar sharing  \cite{Billinghurst2002}, or sharing realistic 3D models superimposed over the real world \cite{Fanello2016}, or by using virtual avatars to show a live view of remote collaborators and their surrounding space as in the Holoportation system \cite{Fanello2016} (see figure \ref{fig:holoportation}).

\cite{Peddie2017} reviewed the historic uses of wearable displays and AR displays.

% Tobias: Make clear here that scrolling etc is no option as we are constrained by the interactions and would require unobtrusive interactions.
By using a wearable AR display like the Microsoft HoloLens\footnote{https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/hololens}, it could be possible for user to see an AR representation of their social network visible at all times. However, this raise the question of how to visually represent the user's contacts in the network. For example, if a user has a large social network with hundreds of contacts available, visually representing each of themmight clutter the user's visual space.

% This research focus on how to represent a social network with hundreds or thousands of contacts in a wearable AR interface. For example, if there are dozens of virtual tags in an AR view representing people, how can user be able to distinguish between each one? How will this interface scale to support hundreds or thousands of people? This is an important area of research as it will allow users to view and interact with a large number of social network followers in a wearable AR systems, at different levels of privacy and social engagement.

% One of the challenges we are seeking to address is how to manage and represent communication from dozens, hundreds or thousands of contacts in a social network in an AR interface. If there are dozens of virtual tags in view representing people on the user's social network, how can they be distinguished between each other? How will the AR interface scale to hundreds or thousands of people?

\section{Research Questions}

This thesis targets the future where AR devices are used everyday, and social networks are visualised in the AR view. So we address the following research questions: 

\begin{itemize}
    % (chapter 3 - Social AR continuum)
    \item RQ1: How to represent social networks and shared social data on wearable AR devices 
    
    \item RQ1(option 2): What dimensions/factors/parameters in sharing social experiences on wearable AR devices 
    
    % (chapter 4 - annotation continuum)
    \item RQ2: How to represent annotations/tags on shared social experience through wearable AR devices
    
    % (chapter 5 - Sharing data continuum)
    \item RQ3: How to share virtual objects/data with our social network through wearable AR 
    
    % (chapter 6 - visualising social contacts) 
    \item RQ4: How to visualise our social contacts as virtual avatars through wearable AR devices

\end{itemize}

To answer the research questions, this thesis explores how wearable AR can be used for sharing social experiences. These explorations identifies the parameters at which AR sharing for social reasons happen. Once the parameters are defined, we build few system prototypes as a proof of concept of the experience or the interaction design. We then run user studies to test the objectives of the system with human participants. We observe their behaviour and report on the results of these experiments. 

\section{Contributions}

1) Definition of parameters and dimensions of the social AR continuum 
This thesis' main contribution is defining the social AR continuum space which consists of set of parameters that define the space of sharing social experience through AR wearable/hand-held devices. We define the space of AR continuum by exploring the main parameters that can be varied based on the social proximity. These parameters are grouped into the following categories 1) self and other, 2) shared objects and annotation and 3) surrounding environments. Under each of these categories we define the dimensions of variables that affect the shared social experience. 

2) The implementation of the AR experience user interface. For each dimension defined on the continuum, we built a software and hardware prototype to test the user interface design with human subjects. The implementation details are described in the thesis for future studies purposes.

3) User studies and evaluation to validate the parameters of the social AR continuum.  we built a prototype and run a user-study/focus-group to validate the dimensions on the social AR continuum. 

3) High-level design guidelines for interface designers who are building social sharing experiences on AR devices. One of the outcomes of defining the social AR continuum and validating these dimnesions is that it can serve as a high-level experience design guidelines that helps individual/organisations to create AR experiences for social sharing and connection purposes.


% This research is novel and makes the following contributions:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Defining the dimensions in design space of sharing social experiences on wearable AR
%     \item Technical implementing different prototypes of sharing social experiences on wearable devices
%     \item User study evaluations of behaviour and preception of using social AR prototypes.
% \end{itemize}


In summary, this thesis helps to increase the understanding on how to share social experiences through AR devices. The results of the user experiements conducted throughout this research help identifying the imapact of the the social AR continuum parameters on presence, user engagement and user interface usablity, which serves as a guideline for future designs. 

The rest of the thesis is organised as follows: Chapter \ref{ch:continuum} describes the social AR continuum and the parameters/ dimensions involved. Chapter \ref{ch:annotation} describes the shared data and annotation continuum including different implementation of shared annotation and awareness cues on different platforms (handheld and wearable). Chapter \ref{ch:data} describes the surrounding environment continuum including shared 360 videos and 30 captured spaces. Chapter \ref{ch:contacts} describes the continuum of self and others of representing social contacts networks on AR devices.
