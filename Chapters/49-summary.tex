\section{Social Contacts Summary}
%You should add a summary section to the overall chapter discussing how these studies helped to answer the research question

This chapter explored different options of visualising and representing social contacts on wearable AR devices. Options include: 1) changing the visual fidelity of avatars based on the social relationship, and 2) changing the scale and placement of social contacts based on the social relationship. Two user studies were conducted on both dimensions to validate their effect on social presence and usability. 

The following chapter will focus on the shared social data and surrounding environments between social contacts, and how these are represented in AR. 

\todo[inline]{your summary is actually not summarising the results or finding. The most important thing for you to do with this chapter is to have a proper discussion section where you discuss the results. What do they mean, are there any cofounding factors that could have  caused this results. Can they be generalised (external validity). What are other limitations/shortcomings of this study. What is the overall take away message. What is the relevance for the next chapters.}
