\section{Social Contacts Summary}

This chapter explored different options of visualising and representing social contacts on wearable AR devices. Options include: 1) changing the visual fidelity of avatars based on the social relationship, and 2) changing the scale and placement of social contacts based on the social relationship. Two user studies were conducted on both dimensions to validate their effect on social presence and usability. 

The user studies show that viewers over no social filter preferred visual fidelity and social proximity. They also show no difference between displaying social contacts as life-sized or miniature placement. This validates the hypothesis of representing social contacts can be mapped based on the Social AR Continuum based on social proximity between social contacts. 

The following chapter will move to explore different dimension on the Social AR Continuum, focusing on the shared social data and the shared surrounding environments between social contacts, and how these are represented in AR. 

% your summary is not summarising the results or finding. The most important thing for you to do with this chapter is to have a proper discussion section where you discuss the results. What do they mean, are there any confounding factors that could have caused these results. Can they be generalised (external validity)? What are other limitations/shortcomings of this study? What is the overall take away message? What is the relevance of the next chapters?

% Tobias; you do not report if you used one-tailed or two-tailed tests. Also if I recall correctly, you often do not report on tests for normal distribution, but I hope you did them or do you just assume it is not normally distributed? It is actually highly recommended to check for normal distribution. Because if the results follow a normal distribution, then parametric tests should be used, they yield higher accuracy over using non-parametric test per default. I, as a reviewer, would pick up on this.
