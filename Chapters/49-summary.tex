\section{Social Contacts Summary}
%You should add a summary section to the overall chapter discussing how these studies helped to answer the research question

This chapter explored different options of visualising and representing social contacts on wearable AR devices. Options include: 1) changing the visual fidelity of avatars based on the social relationship, and 2) changing the scale and placement of social contacts based on the social relationship. Two user studies were conducted on both dimensions to validate their effect on social presence and usability. 

The following chapter will focus on the shared social data and surrounding environments between social contacts, and how these are represented in AR.
