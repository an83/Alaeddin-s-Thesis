This chapter address the surrounding environment around the user in terms of the Social AR Continuum. The surrounding environment level-of-details can determined based the relationship between the user and the social contact that we're sharing the environment with. In this chapter we study different ways for sharing the surround environment (Panorama, Video Stream and 3D scanned rooms). For each way of sharing, we discuss levels of details that can be shared based on user relationships.
