This chapter address the surrounding environment around the user in terms of the Social AR Continuum. The surrounding environment level-of-details can determined based the relationship between the user and the social contact that we're sharing the environment with. 
The aim of this chapter is to answer the research question \textit{RQ3: "How to share virtual objects/data with our social network through wearable AR"}
In this chapter we study different ways for sharing the surround environment (360 Panoramas \ref{sec:surrounding:360}, 3D scanned surroundings \ref{sec:surrounding:environment}). We also look into partially sharing/hiding \ref{sec:surrounding:hiding} part of the room with social contacts. For each way of sharing, we discuss levels of details that can be shared based on user relationships.
