This chapter addresses the surrounding environment of the user in terms of the social AR continuum. The surrounding environment level of detail can be determined based on the relationship between the user and the social contact with whom they are sharing the environment. The aim of this chapter is to answer the research question \ref{rq:interaction}: \textit{What is the best way to view and interact with shared social data on wearable AR displays?}. In this chapter we study two different ways of sharing the surround environment (360 Panoramas \ref{sec:surrounding:360}, 3D scanned surroundings \ref{sec:surrounding:environment}). We also look into partially sharing/hiding \ref{sec:surrounding:hiding} part of the environment with social contacts, based on privacy concerns. For each way of sharing, we discuss the levels of detail that can be shared based on the user relationships.
