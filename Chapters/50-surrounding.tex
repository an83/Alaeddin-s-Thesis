This chapter addresses the surrounding environment around the user in terms of the social AR continuum. The surrounding environment level-of-detail can be determined based on the relationship between the user and the social contact that they are sharing the environment with.  The aim of this chapter is to answer the research question \textit{RQ3: "How to share virtual objects/data with our social network through wearable AR"}. In this chapter we study two different ways for sharing the surround environment (360 Panoramas \ref{sec:surrounding:360}, 3D scanned surroundings \ref{sec:surrounding:environment}). We also look into partially sharing/hiding \ref{sec:surrounding:hiding} part of the environment with social contacts, based on privacy concerns. For each way of sharing, we discuss the levels of detail that can be shared based on the user relationships.
