\chapter{Social Data in AR} 
\label{ch:data} 

This chapter addresses the shared social data and surrounding environment of the user in terms of the Social AR Continuum. The level of detail can be determined based on the relationship between the user and the social contact with whom they are sharing the data and surrounding environment. The aim of this chapter is to answer the research question \ref{rq:data}: \textit{What is the best way to view and interact with shared social data on wearable AR displays?}. 

% Gun: You may potentially categorise this in a higher level concepts. For example, changing the type of representation (2D photo, 360 photo, 3D ..), spatial parts/amount of representation, and the level of detail (e.g. resolution) of representation. You may want to update the section titles accordingly.

This chapter studies: 1) different types of representing shared social data (e.g., 2D photo, 360-degrees images, and 3D surrounding environment) in section \ref{sec:surrounding:360}, 2) the different levels of detail or resolution of 3D surrounding environments as a type of shared social data in section \ref{sec:surrounding:environment}, and 3) the hiding mechanism and sense of privacy when sharing social surrounding space between social contacts in section \ref{sec:surrounding:hiding}. For each way of sharing, this chapter discusses the levels of detail that can be shared based on the user relationships. 

This chapter studies two different ways of sharing the surround environment (360 Panoramas \ref{sec:surrounding:360}, 3D Scanned Surroundings \ref{sec:surrounding:environment}). Additionally, this chapter looks into partially sharing/hiding \ref{sec:surrounding:hiding} part of the environment with social contacts, based on privacy concerns.
