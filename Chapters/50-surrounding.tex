\chapter{Social Data in AR} 
\label{ch:data} 


% Tobias: Similar to the previous chapters the introduction is relatively abrupt. You do not really transition well from the previous chapter as well as you jump right into the topic. I think you will loose the reader within the first paragraph. 

This chapter addresses the shared social data and surrounding environment of the user in terms of the Social AR Continuum. The level of detail can be determined based on the relationship between the user and the social contact with whom they are sharing the data and surrounding environment. The aim of this chapter is to answer the research question \ref{rq:data}: \textit{What is the best way to view shared social data on wearable AR displays?}.

% Tobias: While the first sentence is ok, the second sentence has so many information that are not introduced. Immediately you talk about level of detail and data and surrounding environment. Maybe you have a good overview graphic from the social AR continuum that you can use at the beginning of each chapter to illustrate which part of the continuum you want to address here. It is also unclear why you are immediately talk about level of details and what is actually ‘data’. You see many question arise so a slower introduction might be a good idea. I know that on some of the things you touched beforehand but then you need to remind the often tired (academics) reader.

% Tobias: - I asked you beforehand and you probably forgot my recommendation but who is your target reader? You should have a good target reader who helps you to identify how much detail you need to provide. It should be a real person that knows something about AR but not necessarily about your thesis. Always if you ask yourself if this is enough detail, you should ask yourself if the target reader would understand you using the details provided. This helps a lot!!

% Gun: You may potentially categorise this in a higher level concepts. For example, changing the type of representation (2D photo, 360 photo, 3D ..), spatial parts/amount of representation, and the level of detail (e.g. resolution) of representation. You may want to update the section titles accordingly.

% This chapter studies two different ways of sharing the surround environment (360 Panoramas \ref{sec:surrounding:360}, 3D Scanned Surroundings \ref{sec:surrounding:environment}). Additionally, this chapter looks into partially sharing/hiding \ref{sec:surrounding:hiding} part of the environment with social contacts, based on privacy concerns. For each way of sharing, this chapter discusses the levels of detail that can be shared based on the user relationships. 

This chapter studies: 1) different types of representing shared social data (e.g., 2D photo, 360-degrees images, and 3D surrounding environment) in section \ref{sec:surrounding:360}, 2) the different levels of detail or resolution of 3D surrounding environments as a type of shared social data in section \ref{sec:surrounding:environment}, and 3) the hiding mechanism and sense of privacy when sharing social surrounding space between social contacts in section \ref{sec:surrounding:hiding}. Studying shared social data (either virtual or a reconstruction of reality) is an important part of the Social AR Continuum which allows social contacts to share their experiences with other and be more connected in the shared space. 

%  You may want to add some sentences here about why this is important to research. Although presumably you've discussed that in the introduction.
