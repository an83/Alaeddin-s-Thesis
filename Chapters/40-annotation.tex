This chapter studies the social AR continuum in term of interactions between users. The interaction is represented by adding an AR tag or annotation on a shared medium to socially connect with other users. 
The aim of this chapter is to answer the research question RQ2: "How to represent annotations/tags on shared social experience through wearable AR devices"
The first section \ref{sec:video} addresses annotation on a live video stream. The second section \ref{sec:3D} studies the annotation on a 3D environment using 3D sensors to detect the shared surrounding environment.
