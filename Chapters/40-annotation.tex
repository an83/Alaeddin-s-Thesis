This chapter studies the social AR continuum in term of interactions between users. The interaction is represented by annotation or adding an AR tag on shared medium to socially connect with other users. The first section \ref{sec:video} addresses annotation on live video streaming medium. The second section \ref{sec:3D} studies the annotation on a 3D environment using 3D sensors to detect the shared surrounding environment.
