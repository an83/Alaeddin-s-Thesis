abstract = {Figure 1. Holoportation is a new immersive telepresence system that combines the ability to capture high quality 3D models of people, objects and environments in real-time, with the ability to transmit these and allow remote participants wearing virtual or augmented reality displays to see, hear and interact almost as if they were co-present. ABSTRACT We present an end-to-end system for augmented and vir-tual reality telepresence, called Holoportation. Our system demonstrates high-quality, real-time 3D reconstructions of an entire space, including people, furniture and objects, using a set of new depth cameras. These 3D models can also be trans-mitted in real-time to remote users. This allows users wearing virtual or augmented reality displays to see, hear and interact with remote participants in 3D, almost as if they were present in the same physical space. From an audio-visual perspec-tive, communicating and interacting with remote users edges closer to face-to-face communication. This paper describes the Holoportation technical system in full, its key interactive capabilities, the application scenarios it enables, and an initial qualitative study of using this new communication medium.},

@article{Hollerer2001,
abstract = {Mobile Augmented Reality Systems (MARS) have the potential to revolutionize the way in which information is provided to users. Virtual information can be directly integrated with the real world surrounding the mobile user, who can interact with it to display related information, to pose and resolve queries, and to collaborate with other users. However, we believe that the benefits of MARS will only be achieved if the user interface (UI) is actively managed so as to maximize the relevance and minimize the confusion of the virtual material relative to the real world. This article addresses some of the steps involved in this process, focusing on the design and layout of the mobile user's overlaid virtual environment. The augmented view of the user's surroundings presents an interface to context-dependent operations, many of which are related to the objects in view—the augmented world is the user interface. We present three user interface design techniques that are intended to make this interface as obvious and clear to the user as possible: information filtering, UI component design, and view management. Information filtering helps select the most relevant information to present to the user. UI component design determines the format in which this information should be conveyed, based on the available display resources and tracking accuracy. For example, the absence of high accuracy position tracking would favor body- or screenstabilized components over world-stabilized ones that would need to be exactly registered with the physical objects to which they refer. View management attempts to ensure that the virtual objects that are displayed visually are arranged appropriately with regard to their projections on the view plane. For example, the relationships among objects should be as unambiguous as possible, and physical or virtual objects should not obstruct the user's view of more important physical or virtual objects in the scene. We illustrate these interface design techniques using our prototype collaborative, cross-siteMARS environment, which is composed of mobile and non-mobile augmented reality and virtual reality systems.},

@article{Volante2016,
abstract = {Realistic versus stylized depictions of virtual humans in simulated inter-personal situations and their ability to elicit emotional responses in users has been an open question for artists and researchers alike. We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a betweensubjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our s- udy suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical emotional reactions in affective inter-personal training scenarios, but also users' perceptions of personality and social characteristic of the virtual interlocutors.},

Objective measures of movement and chat were automatically collected in real time when participants logged in to Second Life. Data regarding the number of groups and friends was self-reported through online questionnaires on a weekly basis. Results demonstrated that although the social net- works of users continued to broaden over the course of the study, users became less inclined to explore regions, decreased their use of high-energy actions such as flying or running, and chatted less. We discuss implications for theories of virtual social interac- tion as well as the use of Second Life as a social science research platform},

abstract = {Mobile based collaboration such as image tagging and video annotation has become a research hotspot for both academic groups and the industry. Mobile devices running with Google Android or Apples iOS have almost the same computing and multimedia capabilities as modern computers, which enables conducting regular collaborative activities on them. Moreover their embedded geographic sensors can provide useful auxiliary metadata to help improve the accuracy of several collaboration features such as location annotation and tagging recommendation. In this paper, we firstly analyze recent research on mobile based collaboration and annotation projects, and then we introduce our efforts in expanding a collaborative annotation framework to the mobile platforms, especially the android-enabled devices. A prototype of the mobile extension that supports collaborative annotation on real time data streams especially audiovisual streams is introduced as well as several preliminary performance experiments.},

The system is developed to support real world scenarios in which a remote mobile helper guides a local mobile worker performing a physical task. HandsInAir implements a novel approach to support mobility of remote collaborators. This approach allows the helper to perform gestures without having to touch tangible objects, requiring little environment support. The system consists of two parts: the helper part and the worker part. The two parts are connected via a wireless network and the collaboration partners communicate with each other via audio and visual links. In this paper, we review related work, describe technical implementation of the system and envision future work for further improvements.},

In this paper we present a simple and robust augmented reality registration algorithm that can be used to lock annotations given by the remote expert onto parts of the scene viewed by the field worker through a head mounted see-through display. The algorithm can also be used to construct an image mosaic interface for the remote expert to place annotations regardless of the current viewpoint of the field worker. We also present a networkable desktop-based augmented reality prototype system to test the registration algorithm. A manual recalibration user interface is implemented to deal with registration errors},

In particular, we propose filtering the level of detail of sharing the surrounding environment based on the social proximity between the viewer and the sharer. We test the effect of having the filter (varying levels of detail) on the shared surrounding environment on the sense of privacy from both viewer and sharer perspectives and conducted a pilot study using HoloLens. We report on semi-structured question- naire results and suggest future directions in the social sharing of surrounding environments.},

abstract = {Post-task ratings of difficulty in a usability test have the potential to provide diagnostic information and be an additional measure of user satisfaction. But the ratings need to be reliable as well as easy to use for both respondents and researchers. Three one-question rating types were compared in a study with 26 participants who attempted the same five tasks with two software applications. The types were a Likert scale, a Usability Magnitude Estimation (UME) judgment, and a Subjective Mental Effort Question (SMEQ). All three types could distinguish between the applications with 26 participants, but the Likert and SMEQ types were more sensitive with small sample sizes. Both the Likert and SMEQ types were easy to learn and quick to execute. The online version of the SMEQ question was highly correlated with other measures and had equal sensitivity to the Likert question type.},

abstract = {Virtual social worlds, such as the Internet site Second Life, have acquired a high degree of popularity in the popular and business press. In this article we address the increasing importance of virtual social worlds, and discuss how companies can make use of their potential. We first present how virtual social worlds evolved historically, how they fit into the postmodern paradigm of our time, and how they differ from other social media, such as content communities (e.g., YouTube), social networking sites and blogs (e.g., Facebook), collaborative projects (e.g., Wikipedia), and virtual game worlds (e.g., World of Warcraft). We subsequently present how firms can make use of virtual social worlds in the areas of advertising/communication, virtual product sales (v-Commerce), marketing research, human resources, and internal process management. We also highlight the points companies should pay particular attention to in their activities, the 5Cs of success in virtual social worlds, and the future evolutions that we expect to shape this sector over the next 5-10 years: a trend toward standardization and interoperability, improvements in software usability, increasing interconnection between reality and virtual worlds, establishment of law and order, and the transformation of virtual social worlds to business hubs of the future. ?? 2009 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rise of new media channels such as Facebook, YouTube, Google, and Twitter, which enable cus- tomers to take a more active role as market players and reach (and be reached by) almost everyone anywhere and anytime. These new media threaten long established business models and corporate strategies, but also provide ample opportunities for growth through new adaptive strategies. This paper introduces a new ‘‘pinball'' framework of new media's impact on relationships with customers and identifies key new media phenomena which companies should take into account when managing their relationships with customers in the new media universe. For each phenomenon, we identify challenges for researchers and managers which relate to (a) the understanding of consumer behavior, (b) the use of new media to successfully manage customer interactions, and (c) the effective measurement of customers' activities and outcomes.},

abstract = {This multimethod study investigated how avatar appearance influences virtual team performance. This study is the first to integrate the framework of social identity model of de-individuation effects (SIDE) and Self-Identification theory, using “morphing” techniques. Results were obtained from a 2 (team visual similarity: dissimilar vs. similar team avatars) × 2 (member–avatar similarity: cartoon avatars vs. avatar similar to self) experiment (N = 240). The findings indicated that teams using “morphed team avatars,” which combined both a high degree of team visual similarity and member–avatar similarity in their appearances, performed best on the task, and showed greater social attraction than teams in the other conditions. Moreover, content analysis of the chat conversations revealed that these teams interacted more strategically and expressed a greater motivation to solve the task.},

Using multimodal input, especially body gestures, pre-senters control those embedded avatars through which they can interact with the virtual presentation environ-ment in a fine-grained fashion, i.e. they are able to manipulate individual presentation elements and data as virtual props. The goal of our endeavour is to create novel immersive presentational experiences for live stage performances (talks, lectures etc.) as well as for remote conferencing in more confined areas such as offices and meeting rooms.},

We present DynamicDuo, a system that uses an automated, life-sized, animated agent to help inexperienced speakers deliver their presentations in front of an audience. The design of the system was informed by an analysis of TED talks given by two human presenters to identify the most common dual-presentation formats and transition behaviors used. In a within-subjects study (N=12) comparing co-presenting with DynamicDuo against solo-presenting with conventional presentation software, we demonstrated that our system led to significant improvements in public speaking anxiety and speaking confidence for non-native English speakers. Judges who viewed videotapes of these presentations rated those with DynamicDuo significantly higher on speech quality and overall presentation quality for all presenters.},
